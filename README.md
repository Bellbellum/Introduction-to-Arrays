# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Arrays and Inventory Management

## Grade Level: 
Middle School

## Time estimate: 
2 (60 minute) periods

## Overview: 
This two day lesson plan introduces students to arrays. The assignment uses the “building a lunchbox” theme to help students understand how arrays can be used to store and manage a collection of items or “inventory”. Students will edit and extend a provided code template used to create a “LunchBox” class that can add, remove, and list items. This assignment provides a basis for more data structures in the future. 

## Satisfactory Code
This is a great example of code that would receive the full 20 points based on my rubric. The simulation of Maria's lunchbox runs and shows all 4 items, removing the apple and adding juice box. It also lets the user know if the item is not in the lunchbox. It correctly uses the addItem using .push(). My code is functional and fulfills all program requirements. 

## Unsatisfactory Code:
This code is a poor example because it might produce errors or unexpected outputs. Students might confuse similar sounding functions like in this example where it uses .pull() instead of .push(). There is a mistake on Line 16 that is an error in the loop condition. 

## Reflection:
This feels like how I would ideally teach an algorithms and data structures class. I think Data Structures and Algorithms was one of the most challenging classes for us to learn. If I were to take this class again, I would want it to be laid out the way I've demonstrated here where it has clear goals that can be directly posted and outlined in different agile goals. I think the importance of stand-ups and sprints cannot be understated enough. One of the challenges for me was learning how to code with a partner. I really struggled with understanding what it was like to balance out the workload and communicating needs. I think it would be more helpful having a 3rd team member who could delegate the work and organize us better. This class ideally would have included more coding and scaffolding for the students especially because it was last minute made into an asynchronous course.
